# Ion
An IPC and network communication protocol based off of Multicast.  
Built in support to handle UDP's unrealiablity, along with a heartbeat system to determine the "alive" state of a node.

This library will be the base for the Ion standard. (A specification of the protocol that other languages can implement, and can use to talk to each other.)
